# finalproject_test

This repository contains a minimal example of a court case search system. The
`case_search` package includes a sample dataset and a command line interface for
searching cases by case number.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m case_search.search 105è¨´123
```

This will print out the matching case information from the sample dataset.

This demo provides the basic structure for the search system described in the
project proposal. Future work includes NLP processing of judgment text,
automated data collection, and a more advanced query interface.
